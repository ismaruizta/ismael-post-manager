Task: 

- Create an Angular project with https://the-guild.dev/graphql/apollo-angular 
- Show a list of posts from this https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/ 
- Create a form to write a new post 
- Place a couple of buttons on each post so they could be updated (using previous form) or deleted 


Looking for usage: 

- Angular (latest versions) 
- Apollo and GraphQL 
- OnPush change detection strategy and reactive templates 
- RxJS: We use it extensively, we need to see solid operator usage 
- NGRX: Even if itâ€™s a small test, we want to see how you can manage a CRUD with it 
- CSS vars and utility classes to prevent creating components with bloated css code 
- Directives? Pipes? Show us what you can do with them 


Important: 

- Clean/readable code 
- Feel free to use a css library like Tailwind or Bootstrap
